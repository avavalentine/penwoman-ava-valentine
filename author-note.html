        Writing is not therapy. It’s self-harm with punctuation.  
        If you feel seen in these pages, it’s because you’re bleeding too.  
        These aren’t stories—they’re screams wrapped in metaphors.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t write to be understood. I write because the silence kills more than any scream ever could.  
        To everyone who reads my chaos and still comes back—I see you. I feel you. I break with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every ending hurts because somewhere, a beginning is still begging to exist.  
        And love? Love doesn’t save you. It just makes the wreck look poetic.
