      <p>
        She writes with a scalpel, not a pen. Her stories don’t heal—they haunt.  
        Ava Valentine, known to the wrecked world as <strong>PAV</strong>, doesn’t tell tales.  
        She bleeds truth, stitched in fiction, whispered through chaos.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Based in Paris. Fueled by heartbreak, BLACKPINK, and the soft tremble of undone love.  
        She writes women who feel too much, love too hard, and fall too deep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every chapter is a confession. Every book, a war cry.  
        This is not a safe space. This is a beautiful, burning wreck.
